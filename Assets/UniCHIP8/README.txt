UniCHIP8
  A CHIP-8 implementation for Unity 3D, based on Laurence Muller's tutorial, "How to write an emulator (CHIP-8 interpreter)"
  http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

Creating a basic CHIP-8 virtual machine
  First, import the UniCHIP asset package into your project.
  https://github.com/psema4/unichip8/raw/master/PackageBuild/UniCHIP8.unitypackage

  Getting started
    1. Drag a UniCHIP8 prefab from the prefabs folder into your scene.
    2. Optionally, type in the name of a ROM file located in the Roms folder
    3. Ensure the UniCHIP8's Power State property is checked
    4. Position the camera near the quad so it takes up most of the view
    5. Press Play in the Unity Editor

  Create a custom UniCHIP8 GameObject
     1. Create a quad named Screen
     2. Assign the UniCHIP8Screen material to it
     3. Create an empty GameObject named UniCHIP8
     4. Add the UniCHIP8 component to the UniCHIP8 GameObject
     5. Assign your Screen quad to the UniCHIP8's Screen Object property
     6. Optionally, assign the beep sound to the UniCHIP8's Speaker Sound property
     7. Optionally, type in the name of a ROM file located in the Roms folder
     8. Ensure the UniCHIP8's Power State property is checked
     9. Position the camera near the quad so it takes up most of the view
    10. Press Play in the Unity Editor

Interacting with Unity
  UniCHIP8 offers a number of custom opcodes to interact with your scenes.

  To enable UniCHIP8 Extensions:
    1. Disable the Compatibility Mode property on your UniCHIP8 instance
    2. Add a UniCHIP8 Router from the prefabs folder
    3. Assign it to the Router property on your UniCHIP8 instance

  To make the UniCHIP8 aware of other GameObjects in a scene, they must have the UniCHIP8Node component on them and have a UniCHIP8Router assigned.
